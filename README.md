# GasCameraProject
Bootcamp project
The system receives a record [description]  of the temperature in the air and checks where and if there are gas leaks.
The application uses a dynamic library that manages the reception of the images and processes them  into a video that represents the state of temperatures in colors that symbolize the heat levels.
The management and activation of the functions is carried out by a command line adapted to the camera commands
The start of recording is effectuated with the help of the PIPELINE method which contains 5 stages. Each stage is activated by a separate thread. The communication between the different threads is carried out by a column synchronized by means of a binary semaphore.
Each cycle in PIPELINE forms the image of the gas in the room
So every second 250 images are created that are part of a video
The stages of the PIPELINE:
Capture - creating a gas state image in space which is transferred to the RGB stage
RGB_convertor: Converts the image to RGB format according to the heat degree of the gas and transfers the converted image to the YUV stage.
YUV_convertor: converts an image from RGB format to YUV format and passes it to the DECODER stage
End of recording:
Terminates the recording operation in a controlled manner. After the end of the current cycle, the THREADS will be released and the data structures that were assigned dynamically
Creating an image:
A picture is taken while recording by saving the current picture from the recording, if there is no recording in the background we will perform the first two stages of the pipeline once: and RGB only capture and we will write the encoded image to a file.
